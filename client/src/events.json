And President Putin does not respect, or like, President Obama. So you have a problem. I’m not sure that’s a problem that's easily solvable, there’s a dislike. But Russia does not respect our country any longer. They see that we’ve been greatly weakened both militarily and otherwise. And he certainly does not respect President Obama. So, what I would do would be, as an example, I own the Miss Universe. I was in Russia, I was in Moscow recently, and I spoke indirectly and directly with President Putin, who could not have been nicer. And we had a tremendous success. The show was live from Moscow and we had a tremendous success there. And it was amazing. But to do well, you have to get the other side to respect you, and he does not respect our president, which is very sad.”\n</p>\n<a href=\"http://cfc.press.org/members/transcript/20140527_trump.pdf\">Source: National Press Club</a>"

Kilimnik made at least two trips to the U.S. in April and during the summer of 2016 and met with Manafort. Both U.S. and Ukraine officials suspect Kilimnik has ties to Russian intelligence, which he denies.\n\nIn 2005, Kilimnik was terminated from a decade-long role at the U.S.-based International Republican Institute in Moscow due to suspected Russian ties. He then was hired by Manafort as part of a private equity group that purchased a Ukraine-based cable and internet company from funds provided by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. They also worked for Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov's businesses, which later led to political work when Akhmetov began funding the campaign of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych. In 2006, Yanukovych was elected prime minister and president in 2010. His political party, the Russian-backed Party of Regions paid Manafort’s firm millions of dollars annually. Kilimnik would go on to run the Kiev office for that firm.  Around 2013, the party that arose following the Party of Regions, Opposition Bloc, continued to utilize Manafort's firm. Opposition Bloc stopped paying and Manafort and Kilimnik continued to work together to recoup the unpaid invoices through the time of the U.S. presidential campaign. Kilimnik continues to advise Opposition Bloc.\n</p>\n<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-russia-manafort-235850\">Source: Politico</a>"

He praised Manafort as  \"a good man\" who \"was replaced long before the election took place.\" He repeated Manafort's denial of having any such contact with Russia in response to a follow-up question about whether Manafort was having contact with the Russians in his capacity as Trump's campaign manager, \n\nTrump said, \"Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven't made a phone call to Russia in years. Don't speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn't. I just have nobody to speak to. I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago. We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I'm sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I'm sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk. I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does. Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it.
