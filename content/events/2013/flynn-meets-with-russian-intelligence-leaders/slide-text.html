	In 2013, Michael Flynn traveled to Russia to build a relationship with members
	of Russiaâ€™s intelligence agency, G.R.U. The trip earned him criticism by the
	American intelligence community. Following this trip Flynn hoped to invite G.R.U.
	members to the U.S., but was advised against it. During this period, Russia had
	annexed Crimea and there was fighting between Russian and Ukraine troops.
