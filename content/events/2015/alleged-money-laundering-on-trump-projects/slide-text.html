	A New York court unseals a lawsuit filed on behalf of the state of New York
	against Bayrock, Felix Sater and others. It alleges that the group sought to
	evade taxation and hide its true foreign ownership by laundering as much as $250
	million in profits on Trump projects.

	The attorneys behind the suit tell Forbes that new information leads them to
	believe that Trump participated in the schemes and lied about his involvement.
