	A trove of 300,000 text messages released by an anonymous hacker showed that
	Paul Manafort's daughters, Jessica and Andrea,  were concerned about the
	violence and illegality of Paul Manafort's Russian-supported politicking in
	Ukraine.

	In March of 2015, Andrea texted Jessica, “You know he had people killed in
	Ukraine? Knowingly.” In another message, Andrea said “Don't fool yourself,
	that money we have is blood money.” Andrea also texted someone else that her
	father's work and payment in Ukraine was “legally questionable.”
