  Michael Cohen, Special Counsel to the Trump Organization since 2007, hand-
  delivered a sealed proposal to Michael Flynn's office outlining a way for Trump
  to lift sanctions against Russia. Cohen has connections to Ukraine through his
  Ukrainan wife and past family business dealings there. He also participated in
  deals by the Trump Organization in Russia. The FBI counterintelligence is reviewing
  his links with Russia.

  Michael Cohen, Felix Sater and Andrii Artemenko support the plan. Cohen and Sater
  said they had not spoken to Mr. Trump about the proposal and have no experience
  in foreign policy. Artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans
  from top Putin aides.
