As of March 2017, the FBI continues to investigate computer server connections
between Russia-based Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization. An Alfa Bank-owned
server repeatedly looked up the Trump server’s unique internet address in Summer
2016, accounting for 80 percent of all look-ups to that server during that time
period. The investigation is being handled by the same counterintelligence team
investigating possible Russian interference into the U.S. presidential election.
