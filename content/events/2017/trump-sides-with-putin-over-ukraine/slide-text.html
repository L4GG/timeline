  One day after Trump's call with Putin, renewed fighting breaks out in Ukraine
  between Russian-backed separatists and Ukraine's military. Trump appears to
  side with Putin to cast doubt as to whether the Russian government is supporting
  Russian-backed separatists fighting in eastern Ukraine.

  Trump says of the recent clashes, "we don't really know exactly what that is."

  The Russian government has denied involvement in the three-year conflict, but
  there is evidence it has provided equipment and fighters to the separatists;
  whereas the Ukrainian army has been trained and equipped in part by the U.S.
