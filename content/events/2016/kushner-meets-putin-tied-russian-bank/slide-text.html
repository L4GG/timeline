  Jared Kusher, Trump’s son-in-law, Senior White House Adviser, and head of
  Kushner Companies, meets with executives of Russian state-run development bank
  Vnesheconombank (VEB) in late 2016.
</p>
<p>
  U.S. officials allege that Kushner first met with former National Security
  Adviser Michael Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and then met with
  VEB chairman Sergei Gorkov in December 2016 during a bank roadshow. Gorkov was
  appointed head of the VEB by Russian president Vladimir Putin in early 2016 and
  is a decorated member of the Russian Federal Security Service. VEB, along with
  other Russian banks, has been under Western economic sanctions since 2014
  concerning Russia’s annexation of part of Ukraine.

  Kushner has agreed to testify before the U.S. Senate over suspected Russian
  interference in the presidential election.
