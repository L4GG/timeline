  Russia’s deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told Interfax news agency that
  the Russian government maintained "contacts" with Trump's “immediate entourage.”
  He also said, “We continue to do this and have been doing this work during the
  election campaign,” he said.  The Russian foreign ministry later said there were
  no contacts with Trump's campaign staff, but rather with American politicians
  and supporters, and Trump spokesperson. Hope Hicks denied the campaign was aware
  of any contacts between campaign representatives and Russian officials prior to
  the election.
