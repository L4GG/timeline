  In response to reports that the CIA concluded Russia intervened in the election
  to help Trump win, the Trump transition team issued the following statement:

  destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral
  College victories in history. It’s now time to move on and ‘Make America Great
  Again.’”
