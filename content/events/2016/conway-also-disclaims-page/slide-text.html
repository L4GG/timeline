  Kellyanne Conway told CNN’s Jake Tapper that Carter Page is “certainly not part of the campaign that I'm running, meaning we don't have him — we have a number of people, fabulous people, men and women, as part of our national security and foreign policy team. And he's not among them at Trump Tower."

He is certainly not authorized to do that.”
