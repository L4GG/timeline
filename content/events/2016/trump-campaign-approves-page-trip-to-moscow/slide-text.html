  Prior to his Moscow travels in July 2016, Carter Page asked his supervisor,
  Trump Campaign Director of National Security J.D. Gordon, for permission to
  take the trip. Gordon advised against it. Page then obtained formal approval
  via email from then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and spokesperson Hope
  Hicks. A statement from Hicks stated Page was not representing the campaign in
  Moscow. The campaign fired Lewandowski on June 20, prior to the trip. The
  campaign would later distance itself from Page.
