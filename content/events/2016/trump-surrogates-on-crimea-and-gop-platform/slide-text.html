  Then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort denies on "Meet The Press" knowing
  anything about the change in the Republican platform regarding support for
  Ukraine. That afternoon, Boris Epshteyn, Trump's Russian-born adviser, states
  the Kremlin's party line telling CNN: "Russia did not seize Crimea. We can talk
  about the conflict that happened between Ukraine and the Crimea . . . But there
  was no seizure by Russia. That's an incorrect statement, characterization, of
  what happened."
