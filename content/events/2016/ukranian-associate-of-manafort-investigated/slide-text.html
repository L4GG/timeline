  It is reported that Ukranian-Russian Konstantin Kilimnik, a long-time associate
  of former Trump campaign CEO Paul Manafort, is being investigated by the FBI
  and State Department in part because he may have influenced the GOP platform on
  Russia during the 2016 RNC Convention. Kilimnik made at least two trips to the
  U.S. in April and during the summer of 2016 and met with Manafort. Both U.S.
  and Ukraine officials suspect Kilimnik has ties to Russian intelligence, which
  he denies.

  In 2005, Kilimnik was terminated from a decade-long role at the U.S.-based
  International Republican Institute in Moscow due to suspected Russian ties. He
  then was hired by Manafort as part of a private equity group that purchased a
  Ukraine-based cable and internet company from funds provided by Russian oligarch
  Oleg Deripaska. They also worked for Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov's
  businesses, which later led to political work when Akhmetov began funding the
  campaign of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych. In 2006,
  Yanukovych was elected prime minister and president in 2010. His political party,
  the Russian-backed Party of Regions paid Manafortâ€™s firm millions of dollars
  annually. Kilimnik would go on to run the Kiev office for that firm.  Around 2013,
  the party that arose following the Party of Regions, Opposition Bloc, continued
  to utilize Manafort's firm. Opposition Bloc stopped paying and Manafort and
  Kilimnik continued to work together to recoup the unpaid invoices through the
  time of the U.S. presidential campaign. Kilimnik continues to advise Opposition
  Bloc.
