  Donald Trump proclaims he wants to negotiate nuclear deals with Russia.
  Backed by Roy Cohn, the political operative who advised Joe McCarthy and
  Richard Nixon, Trump said “It would take an hour-and-a-half to learn everything
  there is to learn about missiles. I think I know most of it anyway. You're
  talking about just getting updated on a situation… You know who really wants me
  to do this? Roy… I'd do it in a second.”
