	Belarus-American Sergei Millian, head of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce
	and a real estate agent in Florida claims to have known Trump since 2007. The
	Russian-American Chamber of Commerce said in 2009 it had signed formal agreements
	with The Trump Organization to service Russian real estate clients, but the Trump
	Organization denied that Trump had any such relationship with Millian. As late as
	2016, Millian told a Russian media outlet that he had been in contact with Trump
	and his aides.
