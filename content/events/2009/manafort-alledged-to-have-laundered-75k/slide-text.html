	Ukrainian journalist and lawmaker Serhiy Leshchenko produces documents allegedly
	showing Paul Manafort used offshore accounts in 2009 to launder payments from
	Russian-backed, ex-Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych’s Party of Regions
	totaling $750,000. The offshore accounts were located in Belize and Kyrgyzstan.
</p>
<p>
	Leshchenko released a copy of an invoice on letterhead from Manafort’s
	Alexandria, VA-based consulting company in the amount of $750,000 for the sale
	of 501 computers to a Belize-based company. The invoice, dated Oct. 14, 2009,
	matches an identical amount made on the same day in the Party of Regions “black
	ledger” next to Manafort’s name. Leshchenko alleges that Manafort falsified the
	invoice to legitimize the $750,000 payment to himself.
</p>
<p>
	Manafort previously denied receiving millions in secret payments from the Party
	of Regions, for whom he worked for nearly a decade. Such payments were detailed
	in a previously disclosed “black ledger” slush fund belonging to the party.
