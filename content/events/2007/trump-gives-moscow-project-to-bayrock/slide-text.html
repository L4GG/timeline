  With repeated bankruptcies limiting his access to capital, Donald Trump joins
  forces with New York developer Bayrock after being approached by Russian
  mob-connected Felix Sater. Bayrockâ€™s founder is former Soviet Tevfik Arif.
  Trump said that most of his dealings with Bayrock were through Arif, and that
  his son Donald and his daughter Ivanka were playing active roles in managing
  the project.

  In 1998, Sater avoided indictment for his involvement in a money laundering
  scheme by cooperating with authorities against Russian organized crime.
