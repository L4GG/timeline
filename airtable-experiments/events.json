Kilimnik made at least two trips to the\n  U.S. in April and during the summer of 2016 and met with Manafort. Both U.S.\n  and Ukraine officials suspect Kilimnik has ties to Russian intelligence, which\n  he denies.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In 2005, Kilimnik was terminated from a decade-long role at the U.S.-based\n  International Republican Institute in Moscow due to suspected Russian ties. He\n  then was hired by Manafort as part of a private equity group that purchased a\n  Ukraine-based cable and internet company from funds provided by Russian oligarch\n  Oleg Deripaska. They also worked for Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov's\n  businesses, which later led to political work when Akhmetov began funding the\n  campaign of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych. In 2006,\n  Yanukovych was elected prime minister and president in 2010. His political party,\n  the Russian-backed Party of Regions paid Manafort’s firm millions of dollars\n  annually. Kilimnik would go on to run the Kiev office for that firm.  Around 2013,\n  the party that arose following the Party of Regions, Opposition Bloc, continued\n  to utilize Manafort's firm. Opposition Bloc stopped paying and Manafort and\n  Kilimnik continued to work together to recoup the unpaid invoices through the\n  time of the U.S. presidential campaign.
