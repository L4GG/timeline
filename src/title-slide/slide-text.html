<p>L4GG serves Americans whose rights are at risk, and the attorneys and organizations who help them. L4GG works to collaborate with and enhance, not replace, the excellent work being done by existing progressive advocacy and lawyers groups, and to address unprecedented threats that are not yet being handled by existing groups. L4GG leverages pro bono resources to engage in legal action and persuasive communications; convene coalitions of aligned groups, attorneys, and stakeholders to efficiently coordinate resources; and educate the public and decision makers.</p>
<p>L4GG is putting together this timeline as part of its educational mission. The timeline is still under construction, and we appreciate your patience while we finalize the entry of the numerous instances of interaction between, and denials by, the Trump campaign and administration. We will continue to update the timeline as new information is uncovered.</p>
