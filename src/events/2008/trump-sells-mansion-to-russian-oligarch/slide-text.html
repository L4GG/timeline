	During the summer of 2008, Trump makes significant money when he sells a
	mansion in Palm Beach for $95 million to Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev.
	Trump had purchased the home at a bankruptcy auction less than four years earlier
	for $41.4 million.  At the time, the sale to Rybolovlev is regarded as the most
	expensive residential property sale in U.S. history.
