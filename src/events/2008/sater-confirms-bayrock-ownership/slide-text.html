  Felix Sater was a real estate development partner with Trump through his role as a Bayrock principal. A 2008 e-mail from Sater states, “I am starting to get hyper sensitive to being involved as [a Bayrock] principal directly.” Sater was concerned banks would default on Bayrock projects in light of his association as a principal due to his criminal background.

  The publication by Bayrock’s attorney of his status as a principal to investors during this period spurred him to plan a family trust that gave him an option to later purchase 30 percent of Bayrock.
