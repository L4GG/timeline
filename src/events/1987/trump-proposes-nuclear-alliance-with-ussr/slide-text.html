	Trump proposes that US and Russia partner to form a single nuclear superpower
	to intimidate other countries into submission.
</p>
<blockquote>
“Most of those [pre-nuclear] countries are in one form or another dominated by
the US and the Soviet Union. . . . Between those two nations you have the power
to dominate any of those countries. So we should use our power of economic
retaliation and they use their powers of retaliation, and between the two of us
we will prevent the problem from happening. It would have been better having done
something five years ago. But I believe even a country such as Pakistan would
have to do something now. Five years from now they’ll laugh.”
