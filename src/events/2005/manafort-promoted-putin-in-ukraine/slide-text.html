  From 2005-2009, Paul Manafort received $10 million annually from Russian billionaire and aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally, in exchange for investment strategies and lobbying services on behalf of growing pro-Putin Russian parties in Ukraine.

  Manfort has confirmed he worked for Deripaska, running the services through a company he registered as LOAV Ltd., instead of his consulting firm Davis Manafort. Deripaska described the nature of their business as investment consulting services now related to legal claims, however. There was a 2014 bankruptcy suit in the Cayman Islands between the two parties related to a $19 million investment in Ukrainian TV company Black Sea Cable. Through early 2016, Deripaska accused Manafort of fraud and alleged that Manafort took the money and stopped responding to communications.
