  Russian response to Obama’s Dec. 29, 2016, sanctions announcement was immediate.
  The Russian government made clear that Putin would retaliate in kind. The
  sanctions caused thirty-five Russian diplomats to be expelled from the U.S. and
  two Russian compounds were closed.

  Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskovto, said, “There is no doubt that Russia’s
  adequate and mirror response will make Washington officials feel very uncomfortable,
  as well.” Russian Foreign minister Sergey Larov proposed that Putin “announce
  thirty-one personnel of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and four diplomats from the
  Consulate General in St. Petersburg persona non grata,” as well as the closure
  of two facilities used by American diplomats.
