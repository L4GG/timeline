  “Some of those briefed were 'taken aback' when they learned about Page’s contacts
  in Moscow, viewing them as a possible back channel to the Russians that could
  undercut U.S. foreign policy, said a congressional source familiar with the
  briefings but who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject. The
  source added that U.S. officials in the briefings indicated that intelligence
  reports about the adviser’s talks with senior Russian officials close to President
  Vladimir Putin were being ‘actively monitored and investigated.’”
