  According to The Independent (UK), “State news agency RIA-Novosti and Russian
  website Interfax.com quoted Mr Nikonov, also chairman of the Education Committee,
  as saying: ‘Three minutes ago, Hillary Clinton acknowledged her defeat in the
  U.S. presidential elections and just seconds ago, Trump began his speech as
  president-elect. I congratulate all of you on this.’” News of Trump’s win “was
  almost drowned out by clapping and cheering in the State Duma.”
