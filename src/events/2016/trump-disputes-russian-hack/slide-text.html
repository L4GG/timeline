  During the second presidential debate, Trump disclaims there was any DNC hack.
  He said, “I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.
  [Hillary Clinton is] saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was.
  I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of
  other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400
  pounds, OK?”
