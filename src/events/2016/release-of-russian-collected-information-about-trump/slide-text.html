  An unnamed former Western intelligence officer—who spent almost two decades on
  Russian intelligence matters and who now works with a US firm that gathers
  information on Russia for corporate clients—was assigned to research Trump’s
  dealings in Russia and elsewhere, according to the former spy and his associates
  in this American firm. This was for an opposition research project originally
  financed by a Republican client critical of Trump, later switched to a client
  allied with Democrats. He came across troubling information indicating
  connections between Trump and the Russian government. According to his sources,
  he says, “there was an established exchange of information between the Trump
  campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit.”

  His first memo to the FBI stated: “[The] Russian regime has been cultivating,
  supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN,
  has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.” It maintained
  that Trump “and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence
  from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.” It
  claimed that Russian intelligence had “compromised” Trump during his visits to
  Moscow and could “blackmail him.” The former spy said FBI responded with “shock
  and horror.”
