  Felix Sater, a Russian-born and Mafia-linked businessman, contributed the maximum
  allowed to Donald Trump’s campaign during summer 2016 and claimed to take secret
  meetings in Trump Tower. A campaign spokesperson said at the time that they were
  unaware of Sater’s donations, but later reimbursed him when “Sater gave the
  campaign $5,520 in three donations in July, according to the campaign’s August
  FEC filing. Because the maximum allowed individual contribution is $5400, the
  campaign refunded the $120 difference.”
