Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump met Sergey Kislyak in April 2016 at a VIP reception
at the Mayflower Hotel in D.C. with approximately two dozen guests in attendance.
The event was a cocktail meet-and-greet, followed by a foreign policy speech
delivered by Trump. Kislyak sat in the front row and Trump called for improved
Russia-U.S. relations.
