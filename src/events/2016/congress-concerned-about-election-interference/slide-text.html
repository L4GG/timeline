  Sen. Dianne Feinstein, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, release a joint statement about Russia's interference in the election.
</p>
<blockquote>
“Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
At the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election—we can see no other rationale for the behavior of the Russians.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We believe that orders for the Russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Russian government.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We call on President Putin to immediately order a halt to this activity. Americans will not stand for any foreign government trying to influence our election. We hope all Americans will stand together and reject the Russian effort.”
