  The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government
  directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions,
  including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged
  hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0
  online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed
  efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US
  election process.
