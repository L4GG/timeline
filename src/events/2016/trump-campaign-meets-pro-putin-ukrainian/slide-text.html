  The New York Times and Politico report that Andrii Artemenko met with Trump
  campaign officials after he traveled to Cleveland for last summer’s Republican
  ational Convention. The Times adds that Artemenko says that “he saw in Mr. Trump
  an opportunity to advocate a plan for peace in Ukraine — and help advance his
  own political career.” (Artemenko would later deliver to the White House a peace
  proposal via Trump attorney Cohen, outlining a way to remove U.S. sanctions on
  Russia one week before Flynn’s resignation.)
