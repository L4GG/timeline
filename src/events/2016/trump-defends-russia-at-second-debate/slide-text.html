  During the second presidential debate, Trump said during the discussion of
  hacking of Democratic Party systems, “Maybe there is no hacking but they always
  blame Russia and the reason is because they think they’re trying to tarnish me
  with Russia. I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings
  of Russia. I have no businesses, I have no loans from Russia.”
