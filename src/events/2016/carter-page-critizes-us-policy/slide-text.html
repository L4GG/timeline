  Two weeks before the Republican National Convention, Trump foreign policy adviser
  Carter Page travels to Moscow and once again criticizes U.S. policy. Speaking at
  a commencement address for the New Economic School, an institution funded in
  part by major Russian oligarchs close to Putin, Page asserts that “Washington
  and other West capitals” had impeded progress in Russia “through their often
  hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and
  regime change.”
