  Rex Tillerson, chairman of Exxon Mobil, is nominated for Secretary of State. He
  is a recipient of Russia’s “Order of Friendship” Medal from Vladimir Putin in 2013,
  and is praised by Trump as “much more than a business executive” and a “world-class
  player.” Trump said Tillerson “knows many of the players” and did “massive deals
  in Russia” for Exxon.
