  During the Republican National Convention, Trump’s campaign seeks a tweak to the
  GOP platform, softening a call for the U.S. to provide Ukraine with lethal
  defensive weapons in its ongoing fight with Russian-backed separatists.

  The Trump campaign, at the time chaired by Paul Manafort, worked ahead of the
  2016 Republican Convention on a plank of the 2016 Party Platform that gutted the
  GOP’s longstanding support for Ukrainians' popular resistance to Russia’s 2014
  intervention.

  Manfort worked for more than a decade as a lobbyist for Russian-backed former
  Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych.
