  A “FISA warrant was granted in connection with the investigation of suspected
  activity between the server [at Trump Tower] and two banks, SVB Bank and
  [Russia’s] Alfa Bank.”

  Intelligence community sources said the warrant was sought because actionable
  intelligence provided by foreign agencies could not properly be examined without
  a warrant by U.S. intelligence. The intelligence concerns “U.S. Persons” who
  come under the remit of the FBI and not the CIA Should a counter-intelligence
  investigation lead to criminal prosecutions, sources say, the Justice Department
  is concerned that the chain of evidence have a basis in a clear  warrant. It is
  believed in the intelligence community that the warrant covers any “U.S. person”
  connected to this investigation, and thus covers Donald Trump and at least three
  additional men associated with his campaign.
