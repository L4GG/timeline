  Dmitry Rybolovlev, who claims to have never met Trump yet purchased a home from
  him in 2008, lands at the same tarmac at Charlotte Douglas International Airport
  90 minutes before Trump landed there for a campaign rally. The jets shared the
  tarmac for several hours.

  Rybolovlev had previously paid an unusually large amount for a Florida mansion
  Trump had owned. Trump claims to have never met Rybolovlev, and claims he had
  no idea who paid him $95 million for the mansion.
