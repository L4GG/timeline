At a White House press conference about various topics, Trump responded to questions about Russia. He stated he has “nothing to do with Russia,” had not made any “phone calls to Russia in years,” and doesn't speak to Russians because “I just have nobody to speak to.” He acknowledged having two conversations with Putin, one after the election and one on Inauguration Day. He also stated none of his associates, to his knowledge, have anything to do with Russia.

Regarding former campaign manager Paul Manafort, Trump said Manafort had Ukraine, but not Russian, ties. He praised Manafort as “a good man” who “was replaced long before the election took place.” He repeated Manafort's denial of having any such contact with Russia in response to a follow-up question about whether Manafort was having contact with the Russians in his capacity as Trump's campaign manager,

Trump said, “Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years. Don't speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn’t. I just have nobody to speak to. I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago. We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk. I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does. Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that -- whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that.”
