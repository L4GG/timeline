  Reuters reports the F.B.I. is pursuing at least three separate probes relating
  to alleged Russian hacking of the U.S. presidential elections. One investigation
  is a cyber security investigation to identify the people behind breaches of the
  Democratic National Committee's computer systems in 2015 and the first half of
  2016. The second is an investigation to identify the people who posted emails
  stolen from Clinton campaign manager John Podestaâ€™s account. The third
  investigation concerns counterintelligence. F.B.I. agents are pursuing leads
  related to  examination of financial transactions by Russian individuals and
  companies who are believed to have links to Trump associates.
