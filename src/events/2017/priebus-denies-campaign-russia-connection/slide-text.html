  White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus denied on Fox News that members of Trump’s campaign had contact with Russia before the election and Trump’s win.

  He also said, “The New York Times put out an article with no direct sources that said that the Trump campaign had constant contacts with Russian spies, basically, you know, some treasonous type of accusations. We have now all kinds of people looking into this. I can assure you, and I have been approved to say this, that the top levels of the intelligence community have assured me that that story is not only inaccurate, but it’s grossly overstated and it was wrong.  And there’s nothing to it.”
