  Whatever caused Russia’s ambassador to the United Nation Vitaly Churkin to
  suddenly collapse and die at his desk will remain a mystery at the request of
  Rex Tillerson’s State Department and the Russian consulate. Citing
  “international law” and requests from the federal government, the New York City
  Chief Medical Examiner states that no autopsy will be released and asks that
  all questions be directed to the State Department.

  Churkin, age 64, died Feb. 20, 2017, while working at his desk in the
  consulate’s New York City offices. He served as Russia’s ambassador to the U.N.
  for more than a decade, and “was a fierce defender of his country’s policies,
  including Russia’s incursion in Ukraine and its much-criticized bombing of
  Syria.”
