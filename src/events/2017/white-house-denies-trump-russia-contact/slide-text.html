  During a press briefing, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denies there were contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians prior to the election. She said, “This is a non-story because to the best of our knowledge, no contacts took place, so it's hard to make a comment on something that never happened.”
