	The National Rifle Association, one of Donald Trump’s largest allies, sent a
	30-person delegation to Russia to meet with Putin’s Deputy Prime Minister,
	Dmitry Rogozin, who serves as head of Russia’s defense industry. The NRA claims
	that Rogozin, also chairman of the Russian Shooting Federation, provided a tour
	of the Federation's offices and they discussed a shooting tournament. This trip
	occurred the same week as Michael Flynn’s dinner with Putin.

	Rogozin is well-known in Russia and the U.S. as the “radical” former leader of
	the ultra-right Rodina (“Motherland” in Russian) Party.  In March 2014, the U.S.
	sanctioned him in retaliation for the invasion of Crimea and eastern Ukraine.
